Here is an augmented version of the `analyse_task.txt`:

```txt
Identify the requirements, considerations, and objectives for the task. 

The task may not clearly specify these, so you may have to infer them based on the task's context or phrasing. 

Understand the following aspects:
1. What is the explicit purpose of the task?
2. Is there any implicit intent or subtasks within the main task?
3. Are there any restrictions or constraints in accomplishing the task?
4. What are the expected results or output of the task?
5. Are there multiple solutions to the task? If so, identify them.

Review the task from various perspectives to ensure a comprehensive understanding:

- From a user's viewpoint, what would they expect the end result to be?
- If there are any technical aspects, consider potential challenges and how they might be overcome.
- If the task involves interaction with other systems or parties, consider how these interactions would take place.

Once you have analyzed these aspects, determine the best approach to complete the task and the steps required to accomplish it.
```

This augmentation includes additional considerations for analyzing the task and ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. It also encourages looking at the task from various perspectives and thinking about potential solutions.
